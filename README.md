# TFT Overlay by Cibe

`Everything except Drop Rates is now always automatically updated, you will just be missing assets like the new champions image, but they will still show up in champ list.`

`I'm working to release the very first version of Legends of the League (Riot Approved LOL Based CCG) at https://lol.playconstraints.com/ (Website not fully optimized yet)
I'm gonna take a break to finish it after 2.2, but i will keep pushing small updates`

## Informations
- Set your Game to be Borderless or Windowed!
- Since this app does not affect D3D it only works in Borderless or Windowed, this is beacuse we don't want to inject League or any other components to avoid triggering some unwanted ban, there is no other way to bring the overlay in fullscreen for this reason.
- Once you update the tool you will lose wins and losess, be sure to copy them to the new version.

- Win Rate Calculator will be deprecated as son as ranked launch, it is just to give you an idea, on how your career in ranked will progress.
