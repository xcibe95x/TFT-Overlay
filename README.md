## Informations
- Set your Game to be Borderless or Windowed!
- Since this app does not affect D3D it only works in Borderless or Windowed, this is beacuse we don't want to inject League or any other components to avoid trigghering some unwanted ban, there is no other way to bring the overlay in fullscreen for this reason.

## Menu
- Right click on the title bar to open the menu to quit the applications and other features.
