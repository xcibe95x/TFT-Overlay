# Pocket Tactics a TFT Overlay by Cibe aka (xcibe95x)

IMPORTANT: Updates may slowdown a bit, i started studying again recently, this saturday i will rush new features for v2.8
other vesion will slow down, but at the end we will reach the 3.0 that i preset to be the final version wich will have a different versioning
cause of small updates like new items just in case, beacuse at 3.0 the app will be almost perfect and always up to date all alone.
