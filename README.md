# Pocket Tactics a TFT Overlay for all your Teamfight Tactics needs.

Update 10/11/2019, I finally made my mind and decided to drop support for this, since TFT already own a bunch of usefull features directly in game now, and the need for such tools is fading, but i wanted to leave you with a 3.0 Final anyway
Not completely finished, but working for the latest patch! this will be the last update,thank you for supporting the app.
Hope you enjoyed it and hope it can be usefull for some of you still.

## PLEASE HELP KEEPING THE DATACLOUD.JSON FILE UP-TO-DATE!
