## Informations
- Set your Game to be Borderless or Windowed!
- Since this app does not affect D3D it only works in Borderless or Windowed, this is beacuse we don't want to inject League or any other components to avoid triggering some unwanted ban, there is no other way to bring the overlay in fullscreen for this reason.
- Once you update the tool you will lose wins and losess, be sure to copy them to the new version.

## Menu
- Right click on the title bar to open the menu to quit the applications and other features.
