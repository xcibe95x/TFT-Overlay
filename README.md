# TFT Overlay by Cibe

## Important, this is not dropped, just don't have much time for it! it will be fully automated in 3.0 wich will be the last version
Sorry for the delay, a new update is coming soon on september

I will be pushing smaller updates to get inline with the latest patch before releasing new features i will do my best to automate the tool so it will not require costant updating!
If riot had a better support for this on the API it would have been easier, by now i will be busy but this will be in my focus as soon as i have time.


Now version count will be raised faster even if the changes are small.

## Informations
- Set your Game to be Borderless or Windowed!
- Since this app does not affect D3D it only works in Borderless or Windowed, this is beacuse we don't want to inject League or any other components to avoid triggering some unwanted ban, there is no other way to bring the overlay in fullscreen for this reason.
- Once you update the tool you will lose wins and losess, be sure to copy them to the new version.

## Menu
- Right click on the title bar for the context menu
